<h1>About</h1>
<p>
PuzzleScript was developed by me, <a href="http://www.increpare.com">Stephen Lavelle</a> (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/increpare">@increpare</a>). Programming puzzle games isn't all that hard in the grand scheme of things, but the barrier to entry is way higher than it needs to be.  
<p>
I've worked on a lot of puzzle games, and decided on a particular group of those that could be handily modelled with a scripting language.  I've seen someone do a similar pattern-matching system before (I can't remember who, though), but it was a lot less flexible - the movement system in this engine is what gives it its real power.
<p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
Tech wise, it's based on lots of random code from around the internet.
<ul>
<li>The text editor is a modded version of <a href="http://www.codemirror.net">CodeMirror</a>, which is crazy-awesome.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/antimatter15/jsgif">This</a> gif encoder library can be used to export tremendous animations.</li>
<li>While the idea for this engine had been in my head for a while, I must have drawn some influence from Tom VII's <em>highly</em> original flash game, <a href="http://tinyworld.spacebar.org/">T in Y World</a>.
</li>
<li>While figuring out the scripting language, I tried to port as many puzzle games as I could to the framework. Many of them didn't translate so smoothly - PuzzleScript, try as it might, isn't a general purpose game maker, not even really (yet) a general purpose puzzle game maker, but owes a lot in its design to the current generation of independent puzzle games.</li>
<li>Documentation is all formatted with the highly functional <a href="bootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>. Thanks, twitter!</li>
