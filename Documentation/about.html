<h1>About</h1>
<p>
PuzzleScript was developed by me, <a href="http://www.increpare.com">Stephen Lavelle</a> (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/increpare">@increpare</a>). Programming puzzle games isn't all that hard in the grand scheme of things, but the barrier to entry is way higher than it needs to be.  
<p>
I've worked on a lot of puzzle games, and decided on a particular group of those that could be handily modelled with a scripting language.  I've seen someone do a similar pattern-matching system before (I can't remember who, though), but it was a lot less flexible - the movement system in this engine is what gives it its real power.
<p>
Getting the engine out the door, so to speek, took several weeks of full-time, unreumerated work, and no doubt there's plenty more to come. I am not a wealthy man, I'm an impoverished, self-employed independent game developer whose involvement with such projects amounts to happy indiscretions.  If you appreciate this piece of software, please consider <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=RF7ZTG7FEU7YN&amp;lc=GB&amp;item_name=PuzzleScript%2enet&amp;item_number=puzzlescript%20donation&amp;currency_code=EUR&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted">chipping some money my way</a>, okay? :)
<p>
I've you've made something cool with the engine, please let me know - I'd love to highlight (and maybe even host as examples) wonderful things that people've made with this.
<p>
<h2>PuzzleScript Community?</h2>
<p>
There's no forum or wiki or anything.  If you want to set one up, amazing, otherwise, the main public place to post questions/&amp;c. is <A href="FIX ME">this thread</A> on tigsource.  If you have tech issues/bugs to report, there's the <a href="https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript">github page</a> (of course, it's open source, so you can also fix the bugs yourself and send me the fixes :) ).
<p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
Tech wise, it's based on lots of random code from around the internet.
<ul>
<li>The text editor is a modded version of <a href="http://www.codemirror.net">CodeMirror</a>, which is crazy-awesome.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/antimatter15/jsgif">This</a> gif encoder library can be used to export tremendous animations.</li>
<li>While the idea for this engine had been in my head for a while, I must have drawn some influence from Tom VII's <em>highly</em> original flash game, <a href="http://tinyworld.spacebar.org/">T in Y World</a>.
</li>
<li>While figuring out the scripting language, I tried to port as many puzzle games as I could to the framework. Many of them didn't translate so smoothly - PuzzleScript, try as it might, isn't a general purpose game maker, not even really (yet) a general purpose puzzle game maker, but owes a lot in its design to the current generation of independent puzzle games.</li>
<li>Documentation is all formatted with the highly functional <a href="bootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>. Thanks, twitter!</li>
<li>I use the <a href="https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js">FileSaver.js</a> library for saving files.</li>
<li>The sound engine is a modded version of <a href="http://github.grumdrig.com/jsfxr/">jsfxr</a>, which itself is based upon <a href="http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html">sfxr</a>.</li>
<li>The default color palette used for names is a modified version of the magnanimous Arne's <a href="http://androidarts.com/palette/16pal.htm">Generic 16 color game palette</a>, with additional ones made in consultancy with <a href="starfruitgames.com">Dock</a>.</li>
<li>Thanks to my flatmate <a href="http://terrycavanaghgames.com/">Terry Cavanagh</a> for poking me to add a bunch of neat features which he nonetheless has no intention of using.</li>
<li>I use <a href="http://qunitjs.com/">QUint</a> for unit tests.  It was super easy to get going.</li>
<li>I have an over-the-top pipline that compresses the website before uploading. It uses <a href="http://code.google.com/closure/">Google Closure Compiler</a> (not the advanced mode, I couldn't get that to work) for compressing javascript, <a href="http://yui.github.io/yuicompressor/">YUICompressor</a> for compressing the css files, <a href="http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/">PNGCrush</a> for compressing PNGs, <a href="http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/">Gifsicle</a> for additional compression of the GIFs above what the javascript generator can do, <a href="https://github.com/remy/inliner">inliner</a> for generating the standalone template, and a wee bit of <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html">sed</a>.</li>
