<h2>What is PuzzleScript?</h2>
<p>
PuzzleScript is a game engine designed to help you make tile-based puzzle games.  The most famous tile-based puzzle game is sokoban:
<p>
<img src="images/sokoban.gif">
<p>
Sokoban has one rule:
<ol>
<li><em>if a player is trying to walk into a crate, try to push that crate</em></li>
</ol>
<p>
PuzzleScript allows you to express this succinctly:
<p>
<pre><code>[ > Player | Crate ] -> [ > Player | > Crate ]</code></pre>
<p>
The engine looks for the pattern on the left, and replaces it with the one on the right.  
<p>
<b>></b> is a directional arrow.  The four arrows are <b>&lt;</b>, <b>></b>, <b>^</b>, and <b>v</b>.
<p>
Let's play with the above line of code - what would happen if we changed the direction of the arrows?
<p>
<pre><code>[ &lt; Player | Crate ] -> [ &lt; Player | &lt; Crate ]</code></pre>
<p>
Now, the crates stick to you you when you move away from them!
<p>
<img src="images/sokoban_reversed.gif">
<p>
The engine works like this:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The player is marked as being someone who wants to move</li>
<li>Each of your rules is applied as often as it can be.</li>
<li>Movement happens.</li>
<li>An optional extra stage for rules you want to apply at the very end.</li>
</ol>
<p>
What might you want to do after movements have been applied?  Say you want three crates in a row to vanish (a la <a href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4452540/locklake/index.html">block faker</a>), you do this by adding the following rule:
<p>
<pre><code>late [ Crate | Crate | Crate ] -> [ | | ]</code></pre>
<p>
<img src="images/sokoban_match3.gif">
<p>
If the late keyword wasn't there, the crates wouldn't disappear until the start of the next turn.
<p>
Let's have spooky eyeballs that follow you around.
<p>
<pre><code>[ Eyeball | ... | Player ] -> [ > Eyeball | ... | Player ]</code></pre>
<p>
<img src="images/eyefollow.gif">
<p>
Here's a naughty teleport sprite - whenever she sees you she swaps places with you.
<p>
<pre><code>late [ Sprite | ... | Player ] -> [ Player | ... | Sprite ]</code></pre>
<p>
Don't type that in! It causes an infinite loop, it keeps swapping them back and forth forever.  This fixes it:
<p>
<pre><code>late [ Sprite | ... | Player ] -> [ Temp | ... | Sprite ]
late [ Temp ] -> [ Player ]</code></pre>
<p>

<p>
What if you're <a href="http://www.lexaloffle.com/neko.html">a kitty that likes fruit?</a>
<p>
<pre><code>[ > Kitty | ... | Fruit ] -> [ | ... | Kitty ]
[ > Kitty ] -> [ Kitty ]</code></pre>
<p>
The second line is because we are moving the kitty ourselves, and don't want the game engine letting kitty wander about.
<p>

<p>
What if you want crates that can only be pushed horizontally? 
<p>
<pre><code>Horizontal [ > Player | Block ] -> [ > Player | Block ]</code></pre>
<p>
This only looks for occurrences of the pattern that are horizontal. You could also say vertical instead.
<p>
<img src="images/horizontalblock.gif">
<p>
You can have several patterns rather than just a single row - here's a sumo wrestler that imitates whatever you do, whever you are:
<p>
<pre><code>[ > Player ] [ Sumo ] -> [ > Player ] [ > Sumo ]</code></pre>
<p>
