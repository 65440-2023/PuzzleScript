<h1>Intermediate Directions and Movement</h1>
<p>
Relaive directions rotate along with their pattern
<p>
<pre><code>[ > Player | Crate ] -> [ > Player | > Crate]</code></pre>
<p>
gets compiled to the following set of rules:
<p>
<pre><code>UP [ UP player | crate ] -> [ UP player | UP crate ] 
DOWN [ DOWN player | crate ] -> [ DOWN player | DOWN crate ] 
LEFT [ LEFT player | crate ] -> [ LEFT player | LEFT crate ] 
RIGHT [ RIGHT player | crate ] -> [ RIGHT player | RIGHT crate ]</code></pre>
<p>
You can restrict patterns so that they're only matched in a particular direction.  To implement gravity, we could do 
<p>
<pre><code>DOWN [ stationary Crate ] -> [ > Object ]</code></pre>
<p>
compiles to
<p>
<pre><code>DOWN [ stationary Crate ] -> [ DOWN Object ]</code></pre>
<p>
it would probably have been simpler to write the rule as 
<p>
<pre><code>[ stationary Crate ] -> [ DOWN Object ]</code></pre>
<p>
which is the same thing.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
There are horizontal directons as well - if you want something that moves horizontally when you move horizontally, but ignores you otherwise, you do this
<p>
<pre><code>[ Horizontal  Player ] [ Crate ] -> [  Horizontal  Player ] [  Horizontal Crate  ]</code></pre>
and get this:
<p>
<img src="images/horizontal_follow.gif">
<p>
(Vertical is also a keyword that you can use).
<p>
Vertical and horizontal are both keywords, but is there a way of reducing the following to a single instruction?
<p>
<pre><code>[ ^ Player | Crate ] -> [ ^ Player | ^ Crate ]
[ v Player | Crate ] -> [ v Player | v Crate ]</code></pre>
<p>
There is, and it's this:
<p>
<pre><code>[ perpendicular Player | Crate ] -> [ perpendicular Player | perpendicular Crate ]</code></pre>
<p>
Parallel is also a keyword, and means what you think it might :)
<p>
Rule of thumb: if you don't know what something does in the examples, add the debug statement to the <a href="prelude.html">prelude</a> and see what it produces.  Can you use it to tell what the + in the following code does?
<p>
<pre><code>[ RIGHT Player | crate ] -> [RIGHT player | RIGHT crate] 
+ [ LEFT Player | LEFT Crate ] -> [ LEFT player | LEFT Crate ]</code></pre>
<p>
(that's a pretty advanced feature - it's crazy unlikely you'll need to use it)
